this is a personal project, just to show my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, REACT.

Currently this app has only two function, Todos & Blogs. I am focus on functions not looks of the website, therefore, the website looks bored. 


Page views
Home page:

/todos

/blogs





Functions
Add todos
Mark todos if completed
Delete todos



Add blog
Delete blog
Submit form




Improvement:
I will add a log in system later, so user has name for blogs make it reasonable to create blogs with blogger name.
